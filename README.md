# TypeScript library starter

Based on [TypeScript library starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter), this is a self-use version record, upgrade dependencies to the latest version. Add webpack-dev-middleware local service preview

```shell
# watch build
$ npm start

# production bundle
$ npm build 

# preview on local server
$ npm preview
```
